Project Walk is a web-browser based messenger application. 

Features include:
- account creation
- multiple users
- edit messages
- switch between light and dark mode
- create new chatrooms
- join/remove existing chatrooms

## Installation
There is currently no official release, so the application is only run locally through a code such as VSCode, and by setting up your own database such as MongoDB.
